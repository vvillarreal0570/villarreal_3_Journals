Create a class 'Hero' with health, score, weapon/power, dexterity, perception, level, x, y, z, and a symbol with class constructor.

Public class Hero{
	int healh;
	int score;
	int power;
	int dexterity;
	int precption;
	int level;
	int x;
	int y;
	int z;	
	String Symbol;
	public static Hero(int a, int b, String c){
		int x =a;
		int y = b;
		Symbol = c;
	}
}

public static Hero superman = new Hero;
superman.Hero(9,9, player);

Why to not to initialize the hero in class hero?
-If you wanted level ups.
