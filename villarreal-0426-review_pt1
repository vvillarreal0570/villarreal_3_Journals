Java:
public static  {
    int = n;
  {
    return (n*n);
  }
}

Aduino:
public static  {
    double = x;
    sq (x*x)
  {
    return (sq);
  }
}

Class, object, and constructor:
public Sudent(int age, int grade) {
    age = n;
    grade = x;
    
    Student person = new Student(n, x);
}

What to create in Arduino:
-Arduino is a low level program, so I think it should be appropriate to create more complex commands.
